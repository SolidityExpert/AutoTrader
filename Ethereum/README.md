# Ethereum AutoTrader
<strong>Deploy the AutoTrade.sol contract to the Etherium mainnet, if you dont know how to do this you can find out how on google or youtube.</strong> 

<strong>How to use AutoTrader on <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">remix ide</a> (Will work the same anywhere else):</strong> <br>

Step 1. Find out the contracts address, you can do this by calling the contractAddress function built into the contract. then Copy it for step 2. <br>

Step 2. Send the amount of Eth you want to use to your AutoTrader contract address, this will store Eth in your contract. <br>

step 3. Call the "start" function to start the process. If you are using 0.1 eth or more call the "additionalStart" function instead for better results. <br>

step 4. To get your funds call the withdraw function and you are ready to go again. <br>
