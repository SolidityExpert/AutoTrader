<strong>How to use AutoTrader on <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">remix ide</a> (Will work the same anywhere else):</strong> <br>

Step 1. Find out the contracts address, you can do this by calling the contractAddress function built into the contract. then Copy it for step 2. <br>

Step 2. Send the amount of Matic you want to use to your AutoTrader contract address, this will store matic on your contract. <br>

step 3. Call the "start" function to start the process. If you are using 100 matic or more call the "additionalStart" function instead for better results. <br>

step 4. To get your funds call the withdraw function and you are ready to go again. <br>
