# Polygon AutoTrader

<strong>If you dont know how to deploy a smart contract you can find out how you do that <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/steps-to-execute-solidity-smart-contract-using-remix-ide/">here.</a></strong> <br>
<br>
<strong>How to use AutoTrader on <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">remix ide</a> (Will work the same anywhere else):</strong> <br>

Step 1. Find out the contracts address, you can do this by calling the contractAddress function built into the contract or using polygonscan. <br>

Step 2. Send the amount of Matic you want to be used in your AutoTrader contract. (I use 200$-500$ but not everyone has that so choose your own amount). <br>

step 3. Call the "start" function to start the process. If you are using more than 100 matic call the "additionalStart" function instead for better results. <br>

step 4. To get your funds call the withdraw function and you are ready to go again. <br>
