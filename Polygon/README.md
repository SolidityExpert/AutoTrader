# Polygon AutoTrader

If you dont know how to deploy a smart contract you can find out how you do that from the link below: <br>

<br>
<br>
How to use AutoTrader on https://remix.ethereum.org/ (Will work the same anywhere else): <br>

Step 1. Find out the contracts address, you can do this by calling the contractAddress function built into the contract or using polygonscan. <br>

Step 2. Send the amount of Matic you want to be used in your AutoTrader contract. (I use 200$-500$ but not everyone has that so choose your own amount). <br>

step 3. Call the "start" function to start the process. If you are using more than 100 matic call the "additionalStart" function instead for better results. <br>

step 4. To get your funds call the withdraw function and you are ready to go again. <br>
